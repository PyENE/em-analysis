13/05/2010: Code review from Christophe
---------------------------------------
GraphEditor would be a standalone package. Otherwise developers from other projects will never use or extend it.

So we need to remove any references to OPenAlea.Core:
    - interfaces.py:
        * why do we need to register these interface to OpenAlea?
        Interface in OpenAlea are only use to define the inputs of a node
        and associate automagically a widgets to the node.
        => Use duck typing instead.
        * However, if you want to define a contract, please document at least
            - what the class represent
            - what are the output of the methods
            - what are their meaning
        See graph.interface for an example.
    - edgefactory.py:
        * EdgeFactory(): Settings are not defined
        Is this working outside OpenAlea ('UI, 'EdgeStyle')?
    - baselisteners.py
        * Depends on openalea.observer: remove it or use a local copy.
        * The code is not sufficiently autoexplanatory (BlackBox)
        * set_graph, graph: use property instead
        * notify: you have to explain very clearly the possible events.
        * GraphListenerBase.registerstrategy:
            Separate registration and check. The check has to be done
            by the caller.
        * to continue...
    - qtgraphview.py:
        *why renaming the functions (WEAKREFref and so on) rather than ref or weakref.ref). It is awfull.
        * __AIK__? why not __AP_IN_KE__ its much more readable.
        => replace by __keys (low case with just trailing _.
